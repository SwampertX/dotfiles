# Dotfiles, personalized

I believe dotfiles have to be built ground up, and personalized. This will reduce bloat and ghostly features that are triggered randomly. :ghost::joy:

## Quick links

- Screenshots
- Install
- TODO (for my own reference)

## My Configuration:

| Category | Choice                         |
| -------- | ------------------------------ |
| WM       | i3-wm, i3-lock, i3-bar, gdm    |
| Font     | Hack (for terminal), Noto      |
| CLI      | Alacritty, Neovim              |
| Others   | Firefox Nightly, Emacs (Doom?) |

### Screenshots (WIP)

### Install

_Update: (08 Dec 2019):_ Tried and tested on **Ubuntu 19.10**. Only requires sudo password once at the start.

```bash
./install.sh
```

### TODOs

- [ ] `update-alternative`: set nvim as default vim
- [ ] create a server script (no sudo access, only cli stuff)
- [ ] failure tolerance (not rerunning stuff again)
- [ ] auto deal with cron scripts (with setup clonning etc)
