# Dotfiles, personalized
I believe dotfiles have to be built ground up, and personalized. This will reduce bloat and ghostly features that are triggered randomly. :ghost::joy:

## Quick links
* Screenshots
* Install
* TODO (for my own reference)

### Screenshots (WIP)

### Install (WIP)
```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

### TODO
* [ ]  Refactor the `install.sh` file into separate bash files
* [ ]  Try the installation in a VM (Currently Ubuntu)
